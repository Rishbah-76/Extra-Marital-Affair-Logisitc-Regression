# ExtraMarital_Affair-Logisitc-Regression
Project Description üìÑ

‚ùÑÔ∏è Built a logistic regression model using statsmodel.api data fair to predict Affair will happen or not based on other dependent variable

        affairs         : measure of time spent in extramarital affairs
        
## Overview :
We have trained the model using simple logistic regression, as the data was suprisingly sorted and scaled, which needed less Pre-Processing
